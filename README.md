# Binary-Classification---Tensorflow
A collaboratively built convolutional neural network in Tensorflow with the goal of accurately identifying images of cats or dogs. Our group faced limitations in hardware, and as such we were only able to have 15 epochs for the model and limited to 4000 total images accross the training and validation sets, with less restrictions a higher accuracy could be achieved. The code was originally made in a Google Collaboration file and was translated into a .py file for usability in visual studio. My model is denoted with my name Evan and generated the highest validity accuracy of the group at ~78% accuracy in image classification, where a higher number of epochs and more diverse imagery would have permitted better fitting. 
The Data set used was pulled from kaggle and is too large to include within the file. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
