# Binary-Classification---Tensorflow
A collaboratively built convolutional neural network in Tensorflow with the goal of accurately identifying images of cats or dogs. Our group faced limitations in hardware, and as such we were only able to have 15 epochs for the model, with less restrictions a higher accuracy could be achieved. The code was originally made in a Google Collaboration file and was translated into a .py file for usability in visual studio. My model is denoted with my name Evan and generated the highest validity accuracy of the group at ~78% accuracy in image classification, where a higher number of epochs would have permitted better fitting.
